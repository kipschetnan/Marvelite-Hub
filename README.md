# Marvelite-Hub
## Description
### Marvelite Hub allows the user to search through a server-side database to find comics any given Marvel character appears in. The user is also able to search all films the character appears in within the Marvel Cinematic Universe through a second server-side API. The user's search history is saved to local storage for convenience, in case the user might need to refer back to a previous search.
